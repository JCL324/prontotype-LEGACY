Prontotype
==========

Prontotype is a lightweight, server-side framework to help you quickly build interactive, data-driven HTML prototypes.

It's great for building responsive design prototypes (especially for larger sites) that typically need a lot of iteration and finessing.

See [http://prontotype.allmarkedup.com](http://prontotype.allmarkedup.com) for **setup instructions** and **documentation**. Prontotype makes heavy use of [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) and [YAML](http://yaml.org/start.html) so becoming familiar with them will help you greatly in mastering everything Prontotype has to offer.

Prontotype lets you:
--------------------

* Quickly build linked, multi-page prototypes with realistic URLs
* Define reusable chunks of HTML to make prototype-wide updates quick and easy
* Separate your layouts from your content using powerful template inheritance
* Mock-up everything from simple login behaviours to complex role-based authentication scenarios
* Use YAML, JSON, CSV or XML files to define data structures that will be accessible throughout your prototype
* Write CSS using Less or Sass (SCSS) and have it automatically compiled for use in your protoype
* Give your pages IDs so you can move them around easily without breaking links
* Use whatever frontend prototyping framework you like
* Auto-generate navigation, forms and more using in-built macros
* And plenty more!



What you'll need to run Prontotype:
--------------------

* Linux-based web server
* A web server like Apache (optionally with mod_rewrite or equivalent enabled) or Nginx
* PHP version 5.3.2+
* [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)

In the works...
---------------

Prontotype is still very young! The following is a list of things (in no particular order) that are on the to-do list for the near-future:

* An **example site** to better show off all the features of Prontotype.
* **Export to static HTML** for easier sharing
* **Extension system** to allow you to model more complex behaviours that need server-side logic.
* The ability to **specify contextual notes** and have their display state toggled easily on and off.
* **WURFL (or similar)**  integration to allow for prototyping of server-side device detection.
* **Coffeescript compiliation** to work in a similar way to the LESS compilation does.
* **Unit tests** to make sure everything is working ok!
